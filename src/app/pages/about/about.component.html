        IIn today’s world, waste disposal is becoming a bigger issue, impacting both our environment and our health. Barangay Balibago, Angeles City, Pampanga, 
        is no exception. With more waste being produced every day and limited ways to manage it properly, the community needs a smarter, more efficient system 
        to handle waste responsibly. That’s where EcoGuard comes in—a digital platform designed to make waste disposal easier, encourage recycling, and promote 
        environmental responsibility among residents.

        management efforts, EcoGuard makes the process more accessible, efficient, and convenient. With real-time updates, educational resources, and interactive 
        features, residents stay informed and engaged in keeping their surroundings clean.
